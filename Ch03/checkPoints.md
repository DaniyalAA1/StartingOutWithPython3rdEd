# Checkpoint Questions Chapter 3

3.1 : What is a control struture? A control structure is a logical design that controls the order in which a set of statements execute

3.2 : What is a decision structure? A decision structure is a control structure that can execute a set of statements only under certain circumstances (alson known as selection structures)

3.3 : What is a single alternative decision structure? A single alternative decision structure is a decision structure that provides only one alternative path of execution. If the condition in the diamond symbol is true, you take the alternative path

3.4 : What is a Boolean expression? A Boolean expression is an expression that is tested by the if statement. They have either true or false outputs.

3.5 : What types of relationships between values can you test with relational operators?  With relational operators, you can determine if a specific relationship exists between two values. For example, the > operatore tests if the value on the left side of the operator is greater than the value on the right side of the operator
3.6 : Write an if statement that assigns 0 to x if y is equal to 20. 
if y == 20:
    x= 0


3.7 : # Write an if statement that assigns 0.2 to 
commissionRate if sales is greater than or equal to 10000.

if sales >= 10000:
    commissionRate = 0.2

3.8 : How does a dual alternative decision strucutre work? A dual alternative decision structure is the flowchart for an if-else statement. One path is taken if the given condition is true, and another path is taken if the condition is false. 

3.9 : What statement do you use in Python to write a dual alternative decision structure? To write a dual alternative decision structure, you use the if-else statement

3.10 : When you write an if-else statement, under what circumstances do the statements that appear after the else clause execute? The statements that appear after the else clause execute if the condition is false. 

3.11 : What would the following code display?
    if 'z' < 'a':
        print('z is less than a.')
    else:
        print('z is not less than a.')
The following code will display z is not less than a.

3.12 : What would the following code display? 
s1 = 'New York'
s2 = 'Boston'

if s1 > s2: 
print(s2)
print(s1)
else:
print(s1)
print(s2)

The following code would display 
Boston 
New York

3.13 : Convert the following code to an if-elif-else statement:
if number ==1
    print ('One)
else:
    if number ==2:
        print('Two)
    else: 
        if number ==3:
            print('Three)
        else:
            print('Unknown)
3.14: What is a compound Boolean expression? A compound Boolean expression is an expression that contains multiple Boolean expressions. Two expressions can be connected into one using logical operators. 

3.15 State T or F

3.17: Short circuit evaluations use a method of elimination to save CPU time for the and/or operators. For the and operator, if the expression on the left side is false, the other expression is not checked because teh expression overall is false if one is false. For the or operator, if the expression on the left is true, it doesn't check the other, and the overall expression is automatically true.

3.20: You can assign he value true or false to a bool variable

3.21: a flag variable is a variable that signals when some condition in the program exists
