Decision structure : a control structure that can execute a set of statements only under certain circumstances (alson known as selection structures)

Diamond symbol: The diamond symbol in a flowchart indicates some condition that must be tested

Conditionally exectued: performed only when a certain condition is true

Single alternative decision structure : provides only one alternative path of execution. If the condition in the diamon symbol is true, we take the alternative path

## 3.3 - Comparing Strings Vocabulary

ASCII : American Standard Code for Information Interchange

Lowercase a through z is represented by numbers 97-112

digits 0 through 9 are stored, and represented by the numbers 48-57, string 'abc123' would be stored in memory as the codes 97,98,99,49,50,51
