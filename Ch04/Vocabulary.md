# Chapter 4 Vocabluary
## 4.1 - Introduction to Repetition Structures

A repetition structure causes a statement or set of statements to execute repeatedly, more commonly known as a loop

Condition controlled loop: uses a true/false condition to control the number of times that it repeats. Can use while statement.

Count controlled loop: repeays a specific number of times. Can use for statement. 

## 4.2 - The while Loop: A Condition Controlled Loop

While condition: while a condition is true, do some task. two parts, where a condition is tested for true or false value, anf a statement or set of statements that is repreated as long as the condition is ture. 

While clause - begins with the word while, followed by a Boolean condition. 

while loop is known as a pretest loop, which means it tests its condition before performing an iteration

infinite loop: continues to repeat until the program is interrupted


## 4.3 - The for Loop;  A Count-Controlled-Loop
In the for clause, variable is the name of a variable. Inside the brackets a sequence of values appears, with a comma separating each value

Python programmers commonly refer to the variable that is used in the for clause as the tar-get variable because it is the target of an assignment at the beginning of each loop iteration.

iterable: an object that is similar to a list. It contains a sequence of values that can be iterated over with something like a loop

step value: By default, the range function produces a sequence of numbers that increase by 1 for each successive number in the list. If you pass a third argument to the range function, that
argument is used as step value. Instead of increasing by 1, each successive number in the sequence will increase by the step value.
